<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Coders Headquarters (CodersHQ) is a social platform for developers to grow, network, challenge themselves, and gain points by contributing and helping others in this community. This platform was built by the community and for the community. The essence of CodersHq is to inspire everyone to learn to code, share knowledge and learn together.

The CodersHQ Interface project aims to build an interface to work with the backend of the project, this is through a Command Line Interface, which will be used to perform various tasks.</p>

<h3 id="cli">:man_technologist: Command Line Interface</h3>
<p> The Command Line Interface should be a quick method for accessing core and administrator functionality, the interface should be well made and quick to work with and should not have unnecessary steps. Look at the following Github Repo to get inspiration for the CLI Interface <a href="https://github.com/shadawck/awesome-cli-frameworks" target="_blank">Click Here!</a>

(The interface team is not responsible for any backend code.)</p>

<p>As the development begins, requirements will keep getting clearer and this page will be updated accordingly, any question regarding the Interface project can be directed to Muhammad Arsalan Nawazish</p>
